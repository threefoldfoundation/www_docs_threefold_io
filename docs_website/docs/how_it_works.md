# How It Works

## What is the ThreeFold Grid?

The grid is a decentralized Web4 infrastructure layer which allows us to build Web4, for everyone and by everyone.

**The layer is called the ThreeFold Grid and...**

- It is capable of delivering self-healing data, network and cloud at a planetary scale.
- It allows everyone, everywhere to deploy their own sovereign Internet infrastructure. 
- It allows everyone to build the applications of the future (10x less effort, 10x more security).
- It has been operational for years as a working proof of concept with thousands of nodes online. [Check the ThreeFold Dashboard.](https://dashboard.grid.tf)

## Participants

### Farmers (Cloud Providers)

- Individual and commercial farmers connect hardware capacity to the ThreeFold Grid and earn rewards for doing so.
- Over the next years, millions of nodes will be connected to the existing network. [Check the ThreeFold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf).
- Our network technology provides an end-to-end encrypted and ultra reliable connection layer.
- Our storage technology makes sure data is never lost and privacy is guaranteed.


### Developers & System Administrators (Users)

Our platform has a lot of use cases:

- Web2 system administrators can deploy any application on the grid with the tools they are used to work with.
- Web3 enthousiasts can run their blockchain workloads on the grid.
- Web4 developers build the apps (experiences) of the future.

## Web4 Decentralized Architecture

The ThreeFold decentralized architecture has key features.

- Millions of Famers in Farmingpools (v4) deliver the compute, AI, storage and network capacity required.
- Governance is done via the ThreeFold decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
- Web 2 and 3 solution providers & hosters can use the resources on the grid. [Check the ThreeFold Dashboard.](https://dashboard.grid.tf)
- Web 4 developers can create the apps (experiences) of the future.

## Vision

The ThreeFold Grid aims to create a more sovereign, efficient, and evolutive Internet infrastructure that returns control to individual users and reduces reliance on centralized tech giants. 

> A thriving Internet is not only possible, it is being built right now.
>
> *ThreeFold is building Web4...*
> 
> Join the grid and build with us! There are many ways to contribute and interact on the grid. 
> More information will be shared at the launch of ThreeFold V4 on **12.12.24**.

## The Process

- Farmers deploy nodes to the ThreeFold Grid, providing data, network and cloud resources.
- Resources are verified via the **Proof-of-Capacity** minting protocol and made available for workload deployments.
- Users can rent data, network and cloud resources directly through the network via the **Proof-of-Utilization** payment protocol.

## Unique Value Propositions

With a *planet and people-first* philosophy, ThreeFold proposes a new way forward.

1. **Privacy**: Direct control over personal data
2. **Global Accessibility**: Internet infrastructure for underserved regions
3. **Sustainability**: Reduced energy consumption compared to centralized data centers
4. **Economic Empowerment**: Reward mechanism for individuals providing grid resources
5. **Community-driven**: Changes and enhancements to the grid voted by the TFDAO



## Technical Foundation

Threefold has developed an extensive technology platform to make Web4 possible.
