## Evolution of the Internet

### 1960-2000

Originally, the Internet was a free, trustworthy, and peer-to-peer network where collaboration and open communication flourished, laying the foundation for a decentralized vision which we aim to restore today.

### 2000-Present

Between 2000 and now, the Internet has lost its authenticity, becoming increasingly insecure and dominated by commercial interests, compromising the origin vision of a free and open digital space

### Here and Now

We're pioneering a new, autonomous cloud engine that is ultra-secure, green, scalable, and easy to use, delivering a fresh approach to the requirements of a global platform for augmented collective intelligence

## Internet's Natural Progression

The Internet was always meant to be a peer-to-peer infrastructure.

### Web 1.0 & 2.0: Centralized Data

Web 1.0 & 2.0 was people-driven and in essence too way too complex. It was focused on centralized data and was power hungry. It was slow and unscalable. In short, it was too expensive for what it provided.

### Web 3.0 & Blockchain: Share Data

The Web 3.0 & Blockchain was a necessary step and progression, provising solutions to money transfer and smart contracts. Though these services are indispensable and effective, they were and are in essence not usable to build a whole internet (TODO: new internet?). In its infrastructure, it was often too centralized and lacking sovereignty. This technology has its uses, but it is hard to scale and to make private. It also complicated a lot of work for developers

### Web 4.0 & Internet 2.0: Sovereign Data

Web 4.0 & Internet 2.0 lead to an ecosystem that is driven by human and also AI. It is thus an human-AI hybrid internet. This Internet can be sovereign & decentralized, while being totally secure and private. This phase of the Internet can scale indefinitely, is green, self-healing, cost effective and ultra-reliable.

## Internet for All?

Internet is currently not accessible to all. Indeed, the Internet is only available to 50% of the world. As per Fortune, as of 2023, "Only 1 in 3 African women have access to the internet-compared with half of man."

## GDP Negative Internet

Currently, for almost all countries, the Internet is GPD negative, meaning that the costs associated with building, maintaining, and securing the internet outweigh its economic benefits.

See cables are the mode of transportation for internet data. With most large data centers being located in a handful of countries, nations are losing numerous benefits.

This means that there is an amazingly high potential for countries to own their Internet infrastructure and systems. By implementing the technology developed by ThreeFold, the Internet GDP of countries can go from negative to positive.

## ThreeFold Ecosystem

### ThreeFold Grid

The ThreeFold Grid is the result of more than 10 years of work by a dedicated team of passionate indivuals. The grid offers a true decentralized AI, cloud and storage platform with end-to-end encrypted network as a viable and production-ready alternative to power hungry centralized datacenters. The grid provides self-healing capabilities, is ultra-sustainable and has an active community. Currently, 50 M USD has been invested in its ecosystem. The grid is present in more than 60 countries with thousands of nodes.

### The Team

We build on a successful track record. Indeed, our team has built some of the world's most advanced internet and cloud technologies that were later acquired by some of the biggeset names in the space for a cumulative of +USD 600 million and +44% IRR for our investors.

Moreover, our team has set numerous world records, notably world records for web hosting (1997-2002), the first backup data duplication system in the world (2005), one of the first cloud systems (2008), the first multi-site consistent database (2010), the first unbreakable and distributed storage system (2012) and probably the first proof-of-block stake blockchain (2017).

### Our Values

At ThreeFold, we believe that being planet and people first, i.e. never do anything which is not respecting mother earth, and equality for everyone, are a vital combination to a thriving and beneficial ecosystem.

We believe in authenticity, to restore authenticity of people and information, in open-source, for healthcare, legal, software, education, in simplicity, as we believe that complexity is killing progress.

## Augmented Collective Intelligence

At ThreeFold, we are building an augmented collective intelligence to solve tomorrow's problems with tomorrow's intelligence.

While artificial general intelligence is on its way, we believe that a proportionate and effective answer is to build for everyone an augmented collective intelligence for making humans more intelligent. The Augmented Collective Intelligence harnesses the emergent intelligece of large numbers of people and AI-powered machines, all connected in a distributed architecture.

While Artificial General Intelligence is based on AI: machine learning, neural networks, semantic, code and images, Augmented Collective Intelligence is both rooted in AI as described previously, but also has a strong focus on human-machine networks, knowledge graphs, symbolic and abstract reasoning.

In essence, Augmented Collective Intelligence incorporates both the laser-sharp effectivness of AI and also the inspired and intuitive thinking of the humand mind.

This Augmented Collective Intelligence is possible thanks to the ThreeFold's cloud, network and AI capabilities of the grid. 

## ThreeFold Cloud

It all starts with the ThreeFold Cloud. The ThreeFold Cloud offers edge Ai and a complete cloud platform. This enables anyone in the world to access the nearest ThreeFold nodes via the Mycelium network, always finding the shortest path.

You can deploy a ThreeFold node in your home, in a datacenter or in any commercial settings. ThreeFold nodes can host the ThreeFold AI assistant called Hero, helping you in everyday task and enterprises while always being secure, encrypted and private. 

The nodes within the grid, connected via the Mycelium network, enhanced by the Hero AI assistant create a complementary unbreakable Internet compatible with the current one. This means that you can harness the full potential of the current Internet and the culmulation of humankind knowledge via the ThreeFold Cloud Engine: privately and securely 

### Use Cases

## The Internet as Hope for Humanity

At ThreeFold, we believe that the Internet represents an amazing opportunity that brings hope for humanity. We envision a world where we can all own our AI, data and Internet. This world is within reach and we are building it as we speak. We invite everyone to join the ThreeFold ecoystem and to collaborate as they feel inspired.

We think that it is possible to collective build and improve the internet so as it unlocks its unlimited potential of humanity. 

We envision the internet as a freeflow of authentic information, connecting everyone where, unlocking the unlimited potential of humanity.
