# Mycelium VPN

The Mycelium VPN component of the ThreeFold Platform is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and a server on the internet. This "tunnel" allows you to access the internet as if you were physically located at the VPN server's location, effectively masking your actual IP address and location.

What makes this VPN unique is that it uses the Mycelium network, which is end-to-end encrypted and resistant to quantum technologies.
