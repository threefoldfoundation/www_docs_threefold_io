The ThreeFold Nodes are self-healing and autonomoue. They provide data, network and cloud resources to the ThreeFold Platform, and you get rewards for hosting them. Not only that, but each node provides a perfect mix of modern technology and carefully crafted design:

- **A new bare metal operating system**
  - Zero-OS supports all required Web2 and Web3 workloads and allows millions of nodes to operate in full autonomous mode providing lower cost, better energy efficiency, more reliability and security.
- **A Quantum Safe Storage System**
  - The Quantum Safe Storage System is capable of storing data indestructible, efficient, and ultra-scalable. Previous versions of this system are widely used to store Zetabytes of information by large organizations.
- **A Quantum Safe Network System**
  - Mycelium can look for the shortest path, has a built-in naming & CDN (Content Delivery) system, can survive disaster and network cuts much more efficiently as is possible today.

## Self-Healing and Autonomous

ThreeFold nodes are literally plug-and-earn. Connect them to a power source and an Internet connection and you're all set: the nodes will provide data, network and cloud resources and generate rewards. It couldn't be any easier.
