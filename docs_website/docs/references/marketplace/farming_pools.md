# Farming Pools

A farming pool has certain tasks and responsibility. In exchange of their work, farming pools receive rewards. 

## Setting Rewards

Those rewards are first defined by the grid, see [Grid Utilization](./grid_utilization.md). Then, starting end of 2025, each farming pool will define slice prices and rewards to farmers.

## Tasks and Responsibility

A Farming pool takes care of the following:

- Define SLA's, T&C's, Customer Onboarding, ...	
- Support (replace broken nodes)	
- Management infrastructure (monitoring, billing, ...)	
- Sales of The Nodes (or work with vendor(s))	
- Communication with the Farmers in the Pool	
- Price Definition (define sales prices of the slices)	

> Note: As a farmer choses a farming pool, they will have to give a part of their reward to the farming pool.
