# How It Works

## What is the ThreeFold Grid?

The ThreeFold Grid is peer-to-peer cloud computing network that reimagines internet infrastructure through decentralization, sustainability, and user empowerment.

## Key Characteristics

### Decentralized Architecture
- No central control points
- Distributed computing resources across global nodes
- Removes dependency on traditional cloud providers

### Infrastructure Components
- Powered by independent "Farmers" who contribute computing resources
- Nodes provide storage, computational power, and network capacity
- Geographically dispersed to ensure resilience and reduced latency

## Technical Foundation

### Core Technologies
- Blockchain-based resource allocation with the ThreeFold Chain (TFChain)
- Secure, transparent transaction mechanisms thanks to smart contracts
- Zero-OS: Custom lightweight operating system for nodes built on the Linux kernel
- Self-healing and automated resource management via bare metal ThreeFold nodes

## Unique Value Propositions

1. **Privacy**: Direct control over personal data
2. **Sustainability**: Reduced energy consumption compared to centralized data centers
3. **Economic Empowerment**: Individuals can monetize their computing resources
4. **Global Accessibility**: Internet infrastructure for underserved regions

## How It Works

- Farmers deploy nodes to the ThreeFold Grid
- Resources are verified and made available for workload deployment
- Users can rent computing resources directly through the network

## Vision

The ThreeFold Grid aims to create a more democratic, efficient, and sustainable internet infrastructure that returns control to individual users and reduces reliance on centralized tech giants.
