Once you've received your ThreeFold nodes, it takes a few minutes to connect it:

- Plug the Ethernet cable in your node and connect the cable to your router
- Plug the power cable in your node and connect the cable to a power outlet
- Push the power on button to start the node

The node will automatically connect to the grid. That's it!

The node is self-healing and you will need miminal maintenance, if any.
