# Quantum Safe File System

The Quantum Safe File System component of the ThreeFold Platform is a redesigned storage system which can scale to a planetary level. It is super secure, private and fast enough for more use cases. It is designed to operate in a decentralized context and data can never be lost or corrupted.

This storage system is:

- A backend storage system
- It cannot be used by end users
- It's meant to be integrated with a front end storage system like e.g. S3 or a filesystem
