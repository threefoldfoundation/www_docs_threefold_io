# Tokenomics

## Expanding the Grid

ThreeFold is now entering the expansion phase of the grid. We are expanding the grid to millions of nodes and to achieve this bold goal, we are launching the INCA token, the continuation of the ThreeFold Token, TFT. TFT has been with us for years, helping us build the most advanced and complete decentralized cloud engine out there. 

The technology is rock solid and has been tested for years on mainnet. It is now time to enter the new expansion phase of ThreeFold, where we ensure with the INCA token that the grid can expand to millions of nodes and where liquidity is optimal thanks to an innovative, fiat-ready and cross-chain marketplace.

Comprising more than 70% of TFT to the community, the INCA tokenomics ensure that the project can expand organically and provide all the resources needed for the ThreeFold community members to thrive and build. The INCA release will ensure a fair and resilient distribution.

## INCA Token

The ThreeFold INCA tokenomics for the ThreeFold Grid 4.0 has been designed to promote a thriving ecosystem of cloud users, farmers, and validators. It presents a robust liquidity strategy that ensures seamless transfers and secure transactions within our cloud marketplace. Furthermore, by allocating 40 million tokens for farming grants, we're empowering individuals and organizations to contribute to the grid's growth and development.

The proof-of-utilization rewards are distributed in a simpler manner:

- 60% goes to the farmer hosting the node
  - As a reward to provide resources to users
- 20% goes to the Farming Pool
  - As a reward to provide support, SLA, etc.
- 20% to ThreeFold, Guardians, Validators
  - As a reward to host, stabilize and secure the grid

The following chart provides an overview of the INCA ecosystem:

## Distribution

The ThreeFold INCA token distribution is carefully crafted to ensure a major allocation to the community. There can never be more than 4 billion tokens.

By prioritizing community growth, we're creating a collaborative environment where everyone can benefit from their contributions and participate in the project's success. This balanced distribution ensures that a significant amount of tokens is dedicated to the community, creating opportunities for growth and development within our ecosystem.

Here is a detailed version of the distribution:

- **55%: Farmers and Tech**
  - People expanding the network with Router & Node capacity over the multiple releases
  - 18.1%: Farmers & Tech ThreeFold Grid 1-3 (+95% minted, summer 2024)
  - 36.9%: Farmers ThreeFold Grid 4+ (0% minted, summer 2024)
- **7.5%: Community Expansion Rewards**
  - Promotion of the TFGrid, Marketing Activities, ... 
- **7.5%: Grants**
  - We want to expand and build our project together with the community
- **3.8%: Liquidity Providing**
  - DEX, Exchanges, etc.
- **2.5%: ThreeFold Treasury**
- **11.3%: Investors**

## Release Schedule

The INCA token release schedule is designed to balance the needs of different stakeholders, ensuring that everyone has access to their allocated tokens in a predictable and reliable manner. 

Investors will receive their tokens over two years, with equal tranches released at regular intervals. Farmer rewards will be released over three years, incentivizing contributors to continue building and growing the grid. Ecosystem rewards will follow a similar schedule, with token releases spanning four years to promote collaboration and participation within the community.

By releasing tokens in this predictable manner, we're creating an environment where everyone can contribute and benefit from their participation in the ThreeFold Grid 4.0.

This leads to following maximum unlocking table

![](./img/token_release.png)

The vesting accelerates if the token price gets above 0.5 USD, for each 0.1 USD above additional 10% unlocks into the INCA Liquidity pool.

Thanks to the liquidity pool, the price remains stable even if people decide to chose the option to unvest faster.

## TFT to INCA

TFT holders can go to INCA based on following rules:

- There is 1-1 relationship between TFT and INCA
- TFT can only go to INCA, not back
- There is vesting implemented over 2 years
- TFT becomes INCAG token where the INCAG token has the following properties:
  - INCAG gives a given amount of INCA to be minted over 2 years
  - The distribution is of equal parts per month
  - The acceleration unlock rules are: 
    - 10% when INCA token hits 0.5 USD longer than 1 month averaged out
    - 10% when INCA token hits 0.6 USD longer than 1 month averaged out
    - This logic goes on 10% for each additional 0.1 USD increase until it reaches 100%


## Get INCA Tokens

There are only two ways to get INCA tokens. 

- You can reserve an INCA node to be among the first farmers out there to farm newly minted INCA. 
- You can farm the remaining TFT on ThreeFold Grid V3 and convert them to INCA with a one-to-one correspondance.

## Unlocking a Whole Ecosystem

The INCA token allows anyone, anywhere, to access the ThreeFold ecosystem. ThreeFold V4 is a self-healing data, network and cloud Internet insfrastructure laying the foundation for Web4. It is composed of nodes, routers and phones all connected over the Mycelium network, an end-to-end encrypted network working with, and in parallel to, the current Internet.

## Launching Soon

The INCA token is launching soon, by the end of the year or in early 2025. 

Be among the first farmers to mint the new INCA tokens by reserving your INCA nodes.
