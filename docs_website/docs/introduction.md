# Introduction

ThreeFold is a decentralized platform for unbreakable data, peer-to-peer network, and autonomous cloud. Founded by a core team with deep roots in the early Internet, they bring first-hand experience from its origins as a decentralized network to its evolution into today’s centralized systems.

Over the years, the team developed core technological components for a decentralized cloud, a data storage system which cannot fail, and an end-to-end network system – all from the ground up. Subsequently, a global community of independent people and organizations expanded the network as proof that a decentralized open-source Internet can be revived. 

Now, the project is entering its next phase, ThreeFold V4. This phase is focused on commercial expansion, broader adoption, and completing the remaining components needed to form a cohesive and complete alternative to today’s centralized systems.
