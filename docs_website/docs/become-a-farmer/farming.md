# What is Farming?

ThreeFold Farming is a unique concept in the ThreeFold ecosystem where individuals, called farmers, can:

- Deploy nodes (3Nodes) that connect to the ThreeFold Grid
- Contribute computing resources (storage, network and compute) to the decentralized ThreeFold Grid
- Earn rewards for providing capacity and when the 3Nodes have utilization
- Support a peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure alternative to centralized providers
