# Use Resources

Resources on the ThreeFold Grid V4 are available in slices. 

As a consumer you have the capability to look for the slice which are of interest to you in relation to its properties like SLA, location, price, reputation, etc.

Farmers can set the price for the slices. There are minimum and maximum values that can be chosen.
