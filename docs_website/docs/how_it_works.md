# How It Works

## What is the ThreeFold Grid?

A decentralized Web4 Infrastructure layer which allows us to build Web4 by everyone for everyone.

**The layer is called The ThreeFold Grid and ...**

- is capable of delivering self-healing data, network and cloud at a planetary scale.
- allows everyone, everywhere to deploy their own sovereign Internet infrastructure. 
- allows everyone to build the applications of the future (10x less effort, 10x more security)
- operational for years as working proof of concept with thousands of nodes online ([dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf)).

## Participants

### FARMERS (providers)

![](become-a-farmer/become_farmer.png)

- Individual and Commercial Farmers connect hardware capacity to the ThreeFold Grid and earn rewards for doing so.
- Over the next years Millions of nodes will be connected to the existing network ([dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf)).
- Our Network technology provides a end2end encrypted and ultra reliable connection layers.
- Our Storage technology makes sure we can never loose our data and our privacy is guaranteed.


### DEVELOPERS & SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS (users)


![](img/users_all.png)

Our platform is usable by a lot of usecases.

- Web2 System Administrators can deploy any application on the grid with tools they are used too.
- Web3 Enthousiasts can run their blockchain workdloads on the grid.
- Web4 Developers build the apps (experiences) of the future.

## Web4 Decentralized Architecture

The ThreeFold decentralized architecture has key features.

- Millions of Famers in Farmingpools (v4) deliver the compute, AI, storage and network capacity required.
- Governance is done via the ThreeFold decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
- Web 2 and 3 solution providers & hosters can use the resources on the grid see [the ThreeFold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf).
- Web 4 developers can create the apps (experiences) of the future.

## Vision

The ThreeFold Grid aims to create a more sovereign, efficient, and evolutive Internet infrastructure that returns control to individual users and reduces reliance on centralized tech giants. 

> A thriving Internet is not only possible, it is being built right now.
>
> *ThreeFold is building Web4...*
> 
> Join the grid and build with us! There are many ways to contribute and interact on the grid. 
> More information will be shared at the launch of ThreeFold V4 on **12.12.24**.


## Unique Value Propositions

![](img/compare.png)

With a *planet and people-first* philosophy, ThreeFold proposes a new way forward.

1. **Privacy**: Direct control over personal data
2. **Global Accessibility**: Internet infrastructure for underserved regions
3. **Sustainability**: Reduced energy consumption compared to centralized data centers
4. **Economic Empowerment**: Reward mechanism for individuals providing grid resources
5. **Community-driven**: Changes and enhancements to the grid voted by the TFDAO


## Technical Foundation

![](img/threefold_parts.png)

ThreeFold has built core technologies over the years.

- Zero-OS: Custom lightweight operating system for nodes built on the Linux kernel
  - Self-healing and automated resource management via bare metal ThreeFold nodes
- ThreeFold Grid: End-to-end encrypted network always using the shortest path
- Quantum Safe Storage resistant to quantum computer attacks and data can never be lost.
- Hero Agent (v4): Ready to build the apps of the future in full compatibility with web3. 
- Smart Contract for IT: Blockchain-based resource allocation with signed contracts.
  - Secure, transparent transaction mechanisms for deployment of solutions on the ThreeFold Grid.

### Process

- Farmers deploy nodes to the ThreeFold Grid providing data, network and cloud resources
- Resources are verified via the **Proof-of-Capacity** minting protocol and made available for workload deployments
- Users can rent data, network and cloud resources directly through the network via the **Proof-of-Utilization** payment protocol
