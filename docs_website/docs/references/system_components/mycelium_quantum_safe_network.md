# Mycelium Quantum Safe Network

The Mycelium Quantum Safe Network component of the ThreeFold platform is an overlay network which lives on top of the existing Internet or other peer-to-peer networks created.

In the Mycelium network, everyone is connected to everyone. End-to-end encryption between users of an app and the app runs behind the network wall. Mycelium is an overlay network which lives on top of the existing Internet or other peer-to-peer networks created. In this network, everyone is connected to everyone. End-to-end encryption between users of an app and the app runs behind the network wall.

Each user end network point is strongly authenticated and uniquely identified, independent of the network carrier used. There is no need for a centralized firewall or VPN solutions, as there is a circle-based networking security in place.
