# Mycelium Naming Services

The Mycelium Naming Services component of the ThreeFold Platform is a crucial component in distributed systems and networks that provides a centralized way to map names to resources,  allowing different parts of the system to find and access each other easily. It acts as a directory or phonebook, associating human-readable names (like "database server" or "web server") with actual network addresses or other identifiers (like IP addresses).
