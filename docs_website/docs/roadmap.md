# Roadmap

ThreeFold is on its way to build Web4, the natural evolution of the Internet, where humans and artificial intelligence collaborate to develop a new paradigm aimed at advancing planetary well-being while making sure everyone has equal chances.

To achieve this, ThreeFold is building a self-healing data, network and cloud ecosystem composed of phones, routers and nodes. This platform is a complete and cohesive system providing a viable and efficient alternative to current mainstream clouds. 

The whole is bigger than the sum of its parts with this project, as all components interact together to form a cohesive and complete data, network and cloud system.

The following ThreeFold Roadmap presents the current state of the grid and what is to come.

## Present and Future

ThreeFold has accomplished so much over the years, and there is nothing stopping us. We are currently in the fourth phase of the grid, making significant progress towards building a viable alternative to mainstream cloud services.

After more than a decade of work and creation, our vision hasn't changed: we are building a decentralized sovereign alternative to today's centralized Internet model.

We are making significant progress towards realizing this vision. We present here the currently available features and the features that will be available in a near future.

## Completed & Ongoing

ThreeFold has built the foundation for a peer-to-peer cloud platform. Currently, the ThreeFold grid is in more than 60 countries with thousands of nodes online providing data, network and cloud resources to users. 

Anyone can become a farmer and contribute to the expansion of the grid. We've built planetary-scale quantum safe storage and network systems. Our technology has been in production for years and ThreeFold provides modern cloud features to users worldwide.

ThreeFold is actively working on Web4 features for the ThreeFold V4 launch on 12.12.24.
