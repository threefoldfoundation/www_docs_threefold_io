# Offer Resources

Farmers offer data, network and cloud resources by hosting nodes on the ThreeFold Platform.

## Pricing

Farmers and farming pools decide on their own price as long as it stays between the range specified in the [Use Resources](./use_resources.md) section.

## Capacity Rewards

Farmers will get monthly rewards by providing resources to the ThreeFold Grid V4.

The following rewards are guaranteed for a 18-month period starting from activation.

| Components | Rewards (INCA/month) |
|---|---|
| GB Memory | 8.0 |
| GB GPU | TBD |
| TB SSD | 31.5 |
| TB HDD | 7.0 |
| TB Network | 30.0 | 

The release mechanism is over a period of 36 months from the moment the node registers on the grid.

- The first 11 months, all tokens are locked.
- The remaining 25 months, 4% of the total amount of tokens is unlocked monthly until all tokens are unlocked (25 * 4% = 100%).

## Utilization Rewards

The utilization rewards are distributed in a fair and simple manner:

- 60% goes to the farmer hosting the node
  - As a reward to provide resources to users
  - Note: Without counting the guaranteed reward for 18 months
- 20% goes to the Farming Pool
  - As a reward to provide support, SLA, etc.
- 20% to ThreeFold, Guardians, Validators
  - As a reward to host, stabilize and secure the grid

## Minimum Node Specs

- The minimum CPU passmark per GB of memory is 200
- The minimum GB of memory is 16GB
- The minimum TB of SSD is 1TB

While it is not explicitly required, we recommend using DDR5 for the memory and having more than one SSD disk per node.
