# Roadmap


![alt text](img/roadmap.png)


ThreeFold is on its way to build Web4, the natural evolution of the Internet, where humans and artificial intelligence collaborate to develop a new paradigm aimed at advancing planetary well-being while making sure everyone has equal chances.

To achieve this, ThreeFold is building a self-healing data, network and cloud ecosystem composed of phones, routers and nodes. This platform is a complete and cohesive system providing a viable and efficient alternative to current mainstream clouds. 

## On our Way to Web4

ThreeFold has accomplished so much over the years, we are currently in the fourth phase of the grid, making significant progress towards building a viable alternative to mainstream centralized internet and cloud services.

- We are building a decentralized sovereign alternative to today's centralized Internet model.
- We are making significant progress towards realizing this vision. We present here the currently available features and the features that will be available in a near future.

Currently, the ThreeFold grid is in more than 50 countries with thousands of nodes online providing data, network and cloud resources to users as a working Proof of Concept. 

ThreeFold will be announcing more Web4 features on 12.12.24.
